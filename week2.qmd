# week2

This week we learned how to use Xaringan and Quarto book. The following is a ppt about a remote sensing sensor that I made.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%'}
#install.packages('xaringanExtra')
library(xaringanExtra)
xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(
  url="https://uny96.github.io/RSweek2/#1",
  ratio="16:9"
)
```
