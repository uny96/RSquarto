## summary

### lecture

Virginia Norwood designed the Multispectral Scanner which was first used on Landsat 1.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/01week3.jpg')
```

Whisk broom or spotlight or across track scanners

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/02week3.jpg')
```

Landsat7 and the sensors before it are whisk broom.

#### Part 1: corrections

1.1 Geometric

When remotely sensed data is collected, image distortions can be introduced due to view angle, topography, wind and rotation of the earth.

To match known points in the image and a reference dataset.

Input to output:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/03week3.jpg')
```

Output to input:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/04week3.jpg')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/05week3.jpg')
```

The model with the lowest RMSE will fit best.

1.2 Atmospheric

To deal with environmental attenuation caused by atmospheric scattering.

Adjacency effect of remote sensing image: Through atmospheric scattering, the radiation contribution of non-target pixels to target pixels in remote sensing image.

The adjacency effect in remote sensing makes the edge of the object blurred in the remote sensing image, which leads to the passivation and distortion of the remote sensing image.

In order to obtain high precision surface parameters, it is necessary to design a method to remove the influence of adjacency effect on target pixels.

Relative (to something)

Normalize intensities of different bands within a single image

Normalise intensities of bands from many dates to one date

Absolute(definitive)

Change digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance.

Empirical Line Correction

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/06week3.jpg')
```

1.3 Orthorectification / Topographic correction

georectification = giving coordinates to an image

orthorectification = removing distortions\... making the pixels viewed at nadir (straight down)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/07week3.jpg')
```

1.4 Radiometric calibration

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/08week3.jpg')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/09week3.jpg')
```

Radiance refers to any radiation leaving the Earth (i.e. upwelling, toward the sensor.

Irradiance, is used to describe downwelling radiation reaching the Earth from the sun.

Part 2: data joining and enhancement

2.1 Feathering

"Mosaicking".

The base and second image overlap 20 to 30%.

2.2 Image enhancement

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/10week3.jpg')
```

Contrast enhancement

Band ratio

Filtering

PCA

Image fusion
