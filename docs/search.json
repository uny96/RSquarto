    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi! I am Jingwen Wang. I received my bachelor’s degree in Urban Planning and Design from Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. In the process of learning, I had developed a strong interest in GIS. Therefore, in my graduation thesis, I applied remote sensing and GIS knowledge to do the urban flood risk assessment of Suzhou City. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL CASA. This learning diary is for one of my course: CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environment led by Dr. Maclachlan.\nI like watching cartoons in my spare time. My favorite cartoon is Luo XiaoBlack War. It tells the story of a kitten-demon living in the human world. The story is very heartwarming. Sometimes I also try to make little animations myself. I’ve come up with three short stories that I hope to turn into animated films one day.\nAs for my future career planning, I plan to study a second master’s degree in artificial intelligence, and then apply for a PhD to study the application of artificial intelligence in the field of smart cities. I think remote sensing is an important source of data. Learning remote sensing related knowledge and technology can help me realize my academic ideal."

Passive sensors Detects reflected energy, which is in electromagnetic waves, from the sun. Human eye, camera, satellite sensor are passive sensors. Active sensors actively emit electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive. Radar, X-ray, LiDAR are active sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC=velocity of light\nλ=wavelength\nv=frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noscillation vs wavelength\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation (EMR) may be absorbed by, transmitted through, and reflected by surface. It could also be scattered by particles in atmosphere.\nElectromagnetic radiation (EMR): waves of an electromagnetic field\nRadiant energy: energy carried by EMR waves\nRadiant flux: energy per unit of time\nShortwave radiation: energy from the sun\nSolar irradiance flux: energy (solar power) from the sun per unit area per unit time\nExitance/emittance flux: energy leaving a surface per unit area per unit time\nThere are three types of atmospheric scattering: Rayleigh (smaller than the wavelength), Mie (same size of wavelength) and non-selective (larger than the wavelength).\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can “see through clouds” and collect data at night.\nIn most cases remotely sensed data is raster.\nRemotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions: spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric. A spectral signature can be discrete (e.g. multi spectral) or continuous (e.g. hyper spectral). Lower the radiometric resolution the lower the quality of the image and possibility to differentiate features.\n\n\n2.1.2 practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel and Landsat product of Cape Town in South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean and density of band values of the Sentinel"

In the images synthesized by bands 3, 2 and 1, the copper mineralization zone presents a narrow strip pattern of gray, blue and blue. The lead-zinc mineralized zone presents a stripe pattern of grayish white, light grayish yellow, and tan tones. This successfully solved the problem of poor natural environment, inconvenient transportation and difficult field geological survey in the west of the West Kunlun Mountains."

Zheng et al. (2022) used remote sensing data to explore the impact of climate warming on alpine vegetation.\nUsing Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Global Inventory Model and Mapping Study (GIMMS:1982-2015) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS: 2000-2020), the maximum greenness of the Asian alpine region (HMA) was revealed. The Snowless Normalized Phenology Index (NDPI) is a 3-band vegetation index designed to best contrast soil and snow cover vegetation for estimating the beginning of the growing season (SOS). The results are important for understanding the response of alpine ecosystems to asymmetric climate warming. This understanding is of great value for pasture management and future vegetation climate prediction."

For vegetation surface, there is a visible/near-infrared reflectance relationship due to the bsorption of solar radiation by photosynthetic pigments in the visible light band, and the high reflectance in the near infrared band is dominated by the discontinuity of the leaf structure of healthy vegetation. Mishra (2020) uses the retrieved AOD to derive the surface reflectance. A comparison of aerosol and surface reflectance products generated from 106 Cartosat-2S data sets with MODIS-terra products showed that the algorithm significantly eliminated haze from the images, making surface features visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOuatiki (2023) used linear scaling, cumulative distribution function matching, linear regression model and random forest to study the robustness of spatial rainfall product estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the original SRP and the five SRPS corrected using deviation correction techniques."
