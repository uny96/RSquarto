# week 6

## Summary

### Lecture

Part 1: The set up of GEE

1.Terms / jargon specific to GEE

(1)"Geospatial" processing service

\[1\]Geo = Earth's surface (and near surface)

\[2\]Spatial = Any space (not necessarily geographic)

(2)It permits geospatial analysis at scale

\[1\]Scale ?

massive datasets

planetary scale analysis

really quickly (within seconds)

(2)GEE terms/jargons

Image = raster

Feature = vector

Image stack = ImageCollection

Feature stack = FeatureCollection

2.Client vs server side

Client side -- browser

Server side -- where data is stored

3.Scale (resolution)

It refers to pixel resolution.

Part 2: GEE in action (how we use it)

1.Buildings blocks of data (the data in GEE)

Raster data belong to an ImageCollection.

We use the specific function to load and manipulate.

2.Collections, geometries and features

Geometry = point/line/polygon with no attributes

Feature = geometry with attributes

Feature collection = several features with attributes

3.Reducing images (e.g. zonal statistics)

\[1\]var median = collection.reduce(ee.Reducer.median());

\[2\] var meanDictionary = image.reduceRegion({

  reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(),

  geometry: region.geometry(),

  scale: 30,

  maxPixels: 1e9

});

### Practice

In the practice, I learn how to load data, create points, mosaic and clip images, compute texture and do PCA in GEE. The picture below is the output.

```

## Application

@MutangaandKumar19 pointed out that GEE's research in vegetation mapping and monitoring, landcovering mapping, agricultural applications, disaster management and earth science and other fields.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

```

@Venkatappa21 used Google Earth Engine to assess 40 years of droughts and floods and their impact on farmland and crop production. Using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) as a basis for determining drought and flood levels and crop loss levels, crop production losses in the Southeast Asian Monsoon climate zone (MCR) and Equatorial climate zone (ECR) were assessed at grid points with a resolution of 10 × 10 km.

```

The study conducted by @Floreano21 presents data on deforestation in Brazil between 2009 and 2019 and deforestation that is still likely to occur until 2030. Between 2009 and 2019, the Google Earth Engine platform was the basis for performing LULC evaluations in the Rondonia state via a random forest classifier.

## Reflection

This week we focused on learning about Google Earth Engine. In the lecture, I learned GEe-related terms, client and server, and resolution. In my practice class, I did a PCA analysis of an area in India. The main idea of PCA is to map the original data to a new coordinate system through linear transformation, so as to maximize the variance of the data in the new coordinate system, so as to find the main direction or principal component in the data. By reading the literature, I learned that GEE is an expert in vegetation mapping and monitoring, landcovering mapping, agricultural applications, Fields such as disaster management and earth science have wide applications. For example, GEE can be used to measure the damage to farmland caused by droughts and floods. GEE can also monitor changes in land cover over time.
