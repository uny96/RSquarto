## Summary

### City - New York

New York City's population is expected to grow to 9 million by 2050. The population is diverse, with whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians each making up more than 10 percent of the population.

New York City's economy is strong, there are 4.5 million jobs, the gross national product in 1.9 trillion.

Tax is the important source of funds in New York City, New York City will be 40% of the funds for education, housing and economic development.

The six core challenges facing New York City are: rising unaffordability, economic insecurity, wealth and health disparities, a climate emergency, failing infrastructure and shifting needs as well as threats to democracy.

### Policy -- OneNYC 2050

OneNYC 2050 consists of 8 goals: a vibrant democracy, an inclusive economy, thriving neighborhoods, healthy lives, equity and excellence in education, a livable climate, efficient mobility and modern infrastructure.

The problem of warming temperatures due to carbon emissions is a major challenge for New York City to achieve its vision of livable climate. The application of remote sensing is expected to solve this problem.

## Application

Remote sensing technology can help explore the effects of climate change. Zheng et al. (2022) used remote sensing data to explore the impact of climate warming on alpine vegetation.

Using Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Global Inventory Model and Mapping Study (GIMMS:1982-2015) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS: 2000-2020), the maximum greenness of the Asian alpine region (HMA) was revealed. The Snowless Normalized Phenology Index (NDPI) is a 3-band vegetation index designed to best contrast soil and snow cover vegetation for estimating the beginning of the growing season (SOS). The results are important for understanding the response of alpine ecosystems to asymmetric climate warming. This understanding is of great value for pasture management and future vegetation climate prediction.

## Reflection

Livable climate of the city's vision can be linked with some global goals:

C40 Cities is committed to helping the world limit global warming to within 1.5 Â° C.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to climate action as The thirteenth.

Beating the Heat: A Sustainable Cooling faced for Cities of this guide are also concerned about the high temperature problem.
