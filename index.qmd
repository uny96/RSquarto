Hi! I am Jingwen Wang. I received my bachelor's degree in Urban Planning and Design from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. In the process of learning, I had developed a strong interest in GIS. Therefore, in my graduation thesis, I applied remote sensing and GIS knowledge to do the urban flood risk assessment of Suzhou City. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL CASA. This learning diary is for one of my course: CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environment led by Dr. Maclachlan.

I like watching cartoons in my spare time. My favorite cartoon is Luo XiaoBlack War. It tells the story of a kitten-demon living in the human world. The story is very heartwarming. Sometimes I also try to make little animations myself. I've come up with three short stories that I hope to turn into animated films one day.

As for my future career planning, I plan to study a second master's degree in artificial intelligence, and then apply for a PhD to study the application of artificial intelligence in the field of smart cities. I think remote sensing is an important source of data. Learning remote sensing related knowledge and technology can help me realize my academic ideal.
