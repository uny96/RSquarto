Hi! I am Jingwen Wang. I received my bachelor's degree in Urban Planning and Design from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. In the process of learning, I had developed a strong interest in GIS. Therefore, in my graduation thesis, I applied remote sensing and GIS knowledge to do the urban flood risk assessment of Suzhou City. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL CASA. This learning diary is for one of my course: CASA0023 Remotely Sensing Cities and Environment led by Dr. Maclachlan.
